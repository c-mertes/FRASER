\arguments{
\item{x, fds}{FraserDataSet}

\item{...}{Further arguments can be passed to the method. If "zscores", 
"padjVals" or "dPsi" is given, the values of those arguments
are used to define the aberrant events.}

\item{sampleIDs}{A vector of sample IDs for which results should be 
retrieved}

\item{padjCutoff}{The FDR cutoff to be applied or NA if not requested.}

\item{zScoreCutoff}{The z-score cutoff to be applied or NA if not requested.}

\item{deltaPsiCutoff}{The cutoff on delta psi or NA if not requested.}

\item{minCount}{The minimum count value of the total coverage of an intron 
to be considered as significant.
result}

\item{psiType}{The psi types for which the results should be retrieved.}

\item{BPPARAM}{The BiocParallel parameter.}

\item{res}{Result as created with \code{results()}}

\item{geneColumn}{The name of the column in \code{mcols(res)} that contains 
the gene symbols.}

\item{method}{The p.adjust method that is being used to adjust p values per
sample.}

\item{type}{Splicing type (psi5, psi3 or psiSite)}

\item{by}{By default \code{none} which means no grouping. But if 
\code{sample} or \code{feature} is specified the sum by 
sample or feature is returned}

\item{aggregate}{If TRUE the returned object is based on the grouped 
features}
}
\value{
GRanges object

For \code{results}: GRanges object containing significant results.
    For \code{aberrant}: Either a of logical values of size 
    introns/genes x samples if "by" is NA or a vector with the 
    number of aberrant events per sample or feature depending on 
    the vaule of "by"
}
\description{
The result function extracts the results from the given analysis object
based on the given options and cutoffs. The aberrant function extracts 
aberrant splicing events based on the given cutoffs.

\examples{
# get data, fit and compute p-values and z-scores
fds <- createTestFraserDataSet()

# extract results: for this example dataset, z score cutoff of 2 is used to
# get at least one result and show the output
res <- results(fds, padjCutoff=NA, zScoreCutoff=3, deltaPsiCutoff=0.05)
res

# aggregate the results by genes (gene symbols need to be annotated first 
# using annotateRanges() function)
resultsByGenes(res)

# get aberrant events per sample: on the example data, nothing is aberrant
# based on the adjusted p-value
aberrant(fds, type="psi5", by="sample")

# get aberrant events per gene (first annotate gene symbols)
fds <- annotateRangesWithTxDb(fds)
aberrant(fds, type="psi5", by="feature", zScoreCutoff=2, padjCutoff=NA,
        aggregate=TRUE)
        
# find aberrant junctions/splice sites
